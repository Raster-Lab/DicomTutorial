## Quick Start

### What is DICOM?

DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is the international standard for medical images and related information. It defines:
- Medical image file formats
- Network protocols for medical imaging
- Data structures and encoding rules
- Service specifications for image exchange

### Key Use Cases

- Medical imaging system integration
- PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems)
- Medical image viewers
- Radiology Information Systems (RIS)
- AI/ML applications in medical imaging
- Telemedicine applications
